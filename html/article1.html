        <h1>HOW TO MAKE IT FUN</h1>
        <p>
            Cooking together is only fun when you are relaxed and they are happily engaged in what thay are doing. Here are a few things you can do to help minimise the stress and keep your little chef happy.

            <h3>Chose your recipe carefully</h3>
            <p>Keep the following principles in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The shorter the better. Six ingredients and about five or six method steps is the most you can expect from the average toddler.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Avoid cooking on the hob. As toddles cannot cook on the hob safely, they have to watch you and wait. And, as with most things with toddlers, keeping up the momentum is key. The ideal recipe involves a few steps to assemble the ingredients and then into the oven or fridge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the early days, try to avoid ingredients you don't want your toddler to eat: raw egg, raw meats, etc. It might take them time to learn not to stuff everything into their mouths. If it's something that could cause them harm, then the session becomes stressful rather than fun.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't choose a recipe by the pretty pictures alone. The pictures of the food is intentional. My son picks recipes because he likes the look of 'the little bees' or 'pink flowers' and is then disappointed when the end result doesn't look anything like the picture.</p>
                </li>

        <h3>Let them choose</h3>
        <p>When possible, give them choices. For example, they can choose what pizza toppings to use, which fruit to put in the pudding, what shape to cut the biscuits. This is great for their creativity, but also increases their feeling of ownership and therefore enthusiasm.</p>
        <h3>Lay everything out before you start</h3>
        <p>This seems obvious, but I still find myself rummaging around to find a key ingredient while the children get bored and start mucking about with everything I've already got out: chaos and stress ensue and the momentum is gone! All the recipes have a Parent Prep section to help you set up more easily. It is also a good idea to fill a sink or bowl with soapy water and keep a towel handy so you can clean hands when necessary without having to break away from cooking. Or use wipes.</p>
        <h3>Get the children to do as much as possible</h3>
        <p>This ties in with choosing the right recipes-ones where the children can be involved throughout. Having said that, you will almost certainly need to step in to finish a task and perhaps move the recipe on to the next stage. For example, a toddler's idea of mixing is usually to prod it a few times. Encourage them to do more, show them what to do, encourage again and then help them to move on.</p>
        <h3>Timing, timing, timing</h3>
        <p>Picking the right time to cook with a young child is important. Make sure you have minimal distractions and try to avoid cooking with children when they are hungry. They are going to struggle to concentrate if all they want to do is eat everything.</p>

        <div class="text-3">
            <h3>Talk to them</h3>
            <p>Find as many ways as you can to describe what the children have to do, the sillier the better. For example, mixing with a spoon could be 'a helicopter' or 'burying treasure under sand (flour)'. Sing a song which goes with the action, such as 'round and round the garden' for mixing. Use this opportunity to talk to them about the food: whare it came from, its colour, its texture, its taste. It will all help them to understand what they are doing and to stay engaged.</p>
            <h3>Stay calm</h3>
            <p>This is easier said than done when food is going everywhere, your toddler is trying to eat flour and the phone rings. But the most important thing is that it is fun for you both. If it isn't, stop and try again another time.</p>
