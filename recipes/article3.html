        <h1>INGREDIENT TIPS</h1>
        <p>
            Toddlers are impatient. If they want to cook, they want to do it now! Keep key ingredients in stock ready for an impromptu session. And here are some more ingredient tricks to help you adapt your favourite dishes.

            <h3>Ready-made puff pastry</h3>
            <p>The ultimate, easy-to-use, versatile toddler-chef ingredient. Buy ready-rolled if children are too young to handle a rolling pin. Put fruit on top for a sweet tart or pizza toppings for a savoury one. Use as a lid to top any filling you like to make a sweet or savoury pie</p>
            <h3>Ready-made shortcrust (pie) pastry</h3>
            <p>Making shortcrust pastry with a small child is good fun and do-able, but ready-rolled shortcrust is useful for speeding things up. Once you've got the base for a tart or quiche, there are lots of fillings that are easy for a small child to prepare and put in. Shortcrust is also fun to use to wrap ingredients up to make free-form pies</p>

        <h3>Yoghurt</h3>
        <p>This works as a binding agent so is a useful substitute for eggs. Use Greek-style or natural yoghurt, or a flavoured one to inject different flavours and/or more sweetness</p>
        <h3>Vegetables</h3>
        <p>Some vegetables are easy for small children to prepare and some are almost impossible without using a sharp knife or cooking first. Mushrooms, peppers, green beans, cabbage and broccoli can all be torn. Tomatoes, courgettes and aubergines can be chopped fairly easily using a table knife or child-safe knife. Sweetcorn (off the cob), peas and spinach can be used as they are. However carrots, potatoes and other root vegetables will need cooking first before they can be chopped safely</p>
        <h3>Salt</h3>
        <p>It's hard for young children to get the right of amount of salt into the dish and it's also not great if they decide to stuff it directly into their mouths. Using ingredients like bacon, a tinned soup, ready-made pasta sauce or cheddar cheese helps to provide flavour without the need for additional seasoning. But don't assume this means the dishes are salt-free; you're usually just adding salt in a different way. If the recipe does need a little salt, you can add it to another dry ingredient when you are laying everything out so they don't have to handle it.</p>

            <h3>Sugar</h3>
            <p>You can often reduce sugar in recipes, especially cakes and biscuits. And the more used children are to eating things with less sugar, the less of a sweet tooth they will have long-term. If you want to substitute refined sugar with honey, or similar, don't assume it's better for them-there is no consensus about this.</p>
            <h3>Herbs</h3>
            <p>These are a great way to add flavour to a simple dish and are easy for children to handle. Thay can tear herbs like basil and mint, which have larger leaves or use child-safe scissors to cut up parsley and chives. With young toddlers, chop the herbs beforehand for them to pinch and sprinkle on-a great pincer-movement practice for future writing skills. Most herbs are quick germinators, so fun for children to try growing themselves.<p>
