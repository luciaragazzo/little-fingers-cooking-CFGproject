        <h1>COOKING TIPS</h1>
        <p>
            There are lots of different ways to make cooking techniques easier and more approachable for young children. You will come up with your own, but here are a few of the useful ones

            <h3>Softening butter</h3>
            <p>What to do if you forget to take it out of the fridge, or don't have time to let it go soft naturally.</p>
            <p>Some of the recipes need softened butter. You need the butter to be soft enough for a young child to combine easily with another ingredient (think soft enough to sBrquish easily with a finger). However, it is important to soften butter gently. Don't just whack it in the microwave or on th hob. This will change the properties of the butter and might cause the recipe to fail. If you have a microwave, heat the butter at 10-20% of its maximum power for 20 seconds at a time. Every 20 seconds, turn the butter so it softens evenly. You will probably have to do this between four and six times, depending on how hard butter is.</p>
            <h3>Breaking eggs without getting shell in the mixtrue</h3>
            <p>You need to get the children to pull the egg apart rather than crush it in their hands. To encourage this, I usually say a silly rhyme: 'Knock, knock on the door and open'. While singing this I get them to knock the egg on the rim of the bowl and then pull the two halves of the egg apart.

        <h3>Combining butter and sugar</h3>
        <p>The key to this with very young children is to have the butter as soft as possible, otherwise they will not be strong enough to combine it properly. Get them to squash the butter with the back of a wooden spoon and then stir. Keep doing this 'squash and stir' action. You might have to finish the process off, especially if the butter is a little too hard. Recipes often call for butter and sugar to be mixed untill 'soft and fluffy', but the recipes in this book are robust enough that you don't need to worry about this; just get them combined.
        </p>
        <h3>Turning flour and butter into crumbs for pastry or crumble</h3>
        <p>You want the children to rub the flour into the butter with their fingertips rather than squishing it together with their hands. If they squish, they could end up with a lump of dough rather than crumbs. To encourage them to use their fingertips, you can tell them to pretend they are tickling the butter into the flour. We call this process 'tickle fingers'</p>

            <h3>Cutting</h3>
            <p>Strongly recommend that you never use a sharp knife, even if you are cutting with your children. Cutting is a useful skill for your children to learn. The recipes here allow children to practise cutting soft foods with a table knife or a child-safe knife. Get them to tuck their thumb in when they hold the food. I tell my children to 'hide' their thumb in their hand. With the knife in the other hand, get them to do a sawing action forwards and backwards while pushing down on the food. This task needs close supervision and you will probably still need to hold the knife and food with your children long after they have mastered most of the other cooking skills.</p>
            <h3>Pinching</h3>
            <p>If your children need to pick up a pinch of flour to sprinkle it, get them to make a 'duck' or a 'parrot' with their hand, putting fingers and thumb together in a 'quack' or 'squawk'. Then get them to do the same action to pick up the flour. Then get them to rub their thumb over their fingers to sprinkle.</p>
